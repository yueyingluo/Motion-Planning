# Motion-Planning
This is a edited version of https://github.com/ai-winter/python_motion_planning. (git version: c4e3cb21)

You can test several common motion planners and see the corresponding animation in python environment.

We fix problem1: figure axis overlapping; problem2: exception for no obstacles.

We create three diversed environments(empty/narrow passages/cluttered obstacles) to test motion planning algorithms.(see utils/environment/env.py)

To start this project, you may check originREADME.md.
